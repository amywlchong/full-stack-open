# Part 2 - Communicating with Server

These directories house my solutions to the exercises from the course.

## [course-info](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2-communicate-with-server/course-info)

This directory holds an enhanced version of the previous React application that presents multiple courses and their associated information. This application now operates seamlessly regardless of the number of courses or the varying number of parts within each course. The application exhibits core React concepts such as component structuring and data passing using props. It also demonstrates the principle of immutability, a core functional programming concept, with the use of array methods.

## [phonebook](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2-communicate-with-server/phonebook)

This directory houses an interactive phonebook application built with React. It demonstrates key principles of server communication and client-side state management, conducting Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations via server interactions for contact management. The application leverages React hooks (useState and useEffect) for state management and initial data fetching. It further showcases the structuring of components, application of functional programming principles, error handling in asynchronous operations, and user notification practices.

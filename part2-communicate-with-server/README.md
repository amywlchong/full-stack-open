# Part 2 - Communicating with Server

These directories house my solutions to the exercises from the course.

## [course-info](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2-communicate-with-server/course-info)

This directory holds an enhanced version of the previous React application that presents multiple courses and their associated information. This application now operates seamlessly regardless of the number of courses or the varying number of parts within each course.  
**Skills demonstrated:**
- structuring of components
- data passing using props
- application of the principle of immutability with the use of JavaScript array methods

## [phonebook](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part2-communicate-with-server/phonebook)

This directory houses a React-based interactive phonebook application, which allows users to view, add, update, delete, and search for contacts by name. Additionally, it prompts users for confirmation on actions, and displays notifications related to various operations like successful addition, deletion, updates of contacts, as well as any errors.  
**Skills demonstrated:**
- structuring of components
- data passing using props
- application of React hooks for state management and event handling
- interfacing with a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- error handling in asynchronous operations
- implementation of user feedback mechanisms

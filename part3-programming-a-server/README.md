This directory houses my solutions to the exercises from the course.

## [phonebook-backend](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part3-programming-a-server/phonebook-backend)

This directory houses a backend for a simple phonebook application, constructed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The app allows users to view, add, update, and delete contacts (which include name and number attributes) in the phonebook. Error handling is applied for the various operations.  
**Skills demonstrated:**
- Setup and configuration of a Node.js and Express.js application
- Usage of various middleware in Express.js to manage sensitive environment variable data, enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, parse incoming request bodies, serve static files from the 'build' directory, etc.
- Model definition and schema customization in Mongoose
- CRUD operations on a MongoDB database using Mongoose
- Server-side data validation
- Error handling in a Node.js application

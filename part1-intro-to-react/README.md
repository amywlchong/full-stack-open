# Part 1 - Introduction to React

These directories house my solutions to the exercises from the course.

## [course-info](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part1-intro-to-react/course-info)

This directory contains a simple React application that displays course information. This application demonstrates the fundamentals of React such as component structuring and using props for passing data between components.

## [unicafe-collect-feedback](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part1-intro-to-react/unicafe-collect-feedback)

This directory contains a simple React application that simulates a feedback system for a fictional caf√© named "Unicafe". The application allows users to provide feedback in the form of "good", "neutral", or "bad". The statistics of the feedback received are then calculated and displayed. This application showcases fundamental React principles, such as structuring of components and data passing with props. It also demonstrates the use of React hooks for managing component state and handling events.

## [vote-for-anecdotes](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part1-intro-to-react/vote-for-anecdotes)

This directory houses a simple React application that presents a random software engineering anecdote to the user. Each anecdote can receive votes from users, with the application dynamically displaying the most voted anecdote in real-time. This application illustrates the key concepts of React, such as state management, component structuring, and the utilization of props to pass data between components.

## [blog-list-frontend](https://github.com/amywlchong/full-stack-open/tree/master/part5-advanced-React/bloglist-frontend)

This directory houses the frontend for a React-based blog list application. This application interfaces with a backend, providing a full-stack blog listing solution. It allows users to login, add blogs they come across online, view the blogs, like them, and delete them. Each blog includes details such as author, title, URL, and the number of likes. Features also include persistent login through local storage and conditional rendering of detailed blog information. Extensive end-to-end testing has been performed.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Building a React application with multiple components and state management
- Using React hooks for state management and side-effects handling
- Implementing login functionality using token-based authentication
- Managing local storage to persist user session data
- Interfacing with a RESTful API using HTTP requests facilitated by Axios
- CRUD operations using async/await syntax for promise handling
- Handling HTTP response data in a React application and updating component state
- Implementing error handling for failed HTTP requests and displaying error notifications
- Testing React components with various testing strategies, including unit testing, and end-to-end testing using Cypress
